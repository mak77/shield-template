# Optimizing Firefox Search

Mozilla wants to know if we can improve the default search experience in Firefox. Participating in this study will help us find out!

## What will happen next

** If you agree to participate:

1. We will add additional features to Firefox that modify the default search experience
2. Continue using Firefox as you normally would. You may not notice any changes immediately.
3. After 30 days, the study will end on its own. Your Firefox will go back to normal.
4. We will ask you to fill out a quick optional survey to tell us about your experience. The survey should take less than 5 minutes to complete.

## Leaving the study

The study will expire on its own in 30 days. You may leave the study early. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Type about:addons into the location bar, and press enter.
2. Find Search Shield Study in the addons list.
3. Click the remove button.
4. If you opt out of the study early we will ask you to fill out a survey. We’re interested in hearing about your experience, even if you didn’t participate in the entire study.

Opting out of a study does not prevent you from participating in future studies.

## Your privacy
### All Shield Studies

Every Shield Study collects data about important study events, such as install, uninstall, daily usage, and end of study. Studies also include an optional survey.

This data is associated with Firefox [Telemetry collection](https://gecko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/index.html).

### This particular Study
In addition to the data collected by all Shield Studies, here are the key things you should know about what is happening when you participate in this study:

- We will track basic information about your search behavior in Firefox. This includes using the in-product search tools and information about the search providers you may visit.
- No actual search queries will be collected. We will look at numbers of searches performed.
- No information will be collected while in Private Browsing mode

## You Help Make Firefox Better
